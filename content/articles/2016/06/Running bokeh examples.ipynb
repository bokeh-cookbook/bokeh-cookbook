Bokeh has two parts to it the python part (`from bokeh import ...`) and the javascript part (aka bokehjs). By default bokeh uses a pre-built version of bokehjs that lives on our cdn. This is super useful for users because it means that the html they produce isn't full of the bokehjs library. However, the pre-built version of bokehjs will be the latest release version and is almost certainly not compatible with bokeh master which we're downloading an running locally.\n",
